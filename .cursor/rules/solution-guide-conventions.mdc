# Solution Guide Conventions

This repository contains Ansible Automation Platform solution guides published as markdown files and rendered via GitHub Pages with Jekyll.

## Markdown Blockquote Formatting

Blockquotes must use a short first line (under 12 words) followed by a blank quote line, then the detail text. This renders correctly with the site CSS which styles the first line as a colored header bar.

```markdown
# Bad -- long first line wraps ugly in the rendered CSS
> **Warning:** If your guide has fewer than 3 walkthrough steps or fewer than 2 code blocks, it is likely too thin and should be expanded or merged.

# Good -- short label, details below
> **Warning:** Your guide may be too thin.
>
> If it has fewer than 3 walkthrough steps or fewer than 2 code blocks, either expand the scope or merge it with a related guide.
```

Accepted label prefixes: `**Tip:**`, `**Warning:**`, `**Why [tool]?:**`, `**Example ...**`, `**RBAC:**`, or any short bold descriptor.

## Solution Guide Structure

All solution guides must follow the framework in `README-best-practices.md`. Key non-negotiables:

- **Title**: `[Topic] - Solution Guide` format. Must describe an operational outcome, not a product feature.
- **Solution not tutorial**: If it could be titled "Getting started with X," reframe it around the problem it solves.
- **Starter template**: New guides should copy the skeleton from the Appendix of `README-best-practices.md`.
- **Minimum depth**: At least 3 walkthrough steps, 2 YAML code blocks, 1 diagram, ~800 words.
- **Validation section is mandatory**: Include a concrete test command, verbatim expected output, and a troubleshooting table.
- **Automation Hub links**: Every Ansible collection referenced must link to its Automation Hub page.
- **KB article link**: Include the `access.redhat.com` article link in a blockquote directly under the title.

## Scoring and Reviewing Guides

When reviewing or grading solution guides, use the weighted rubric from `README-best-practices.md`:

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Outcome Clarity | 20% |
| Architecture Clarity | 20% |
| Technical Executability | 25% |
| Validation/Testability | 15% |
| Production Readiness Info | 10% |
| Business Framing | 10% |

Score each category 1-5. Multiply by weight for a final score out of 10. Any category below 3 means revise before publishing.

When writing a review:
1. List **Strengths** (what the guide does well).
2. List **Weaknesses** (specific gaps, not vague complaints).
3. List **Suggestions** (actionable improvements with examples).
4. Provide an overall score and a one-line verdict.
5. If reconciling with another reviewer, document the reasoning for any score changes.

Reviews are stored in `opus-review.md` with a scorecard table at the top.

## Jekyll and GitHub Pages

- Layout: `_layouts/default.html` (includes nav header, footer, Prism.js syntax highlighting, copy-to-clipboard on code blocks, and the Konami code Easter egg).
- Styles: `assets/css/style.scss` (extends the `jekyll-theme-dinky` base theme with Red Hat branding).
- Config: `_config.yml` controls excludes and theme settings.
- Files excluded in `_config.yml` are not rendered on GitHub Pages. If a markdown file should be publicly accessible, ensure it is not in the exclude list.

## File Naming

- Solution guides: `README-[topic].md` (e.g., `README-AIOps.md`, `README-IA.md`)
- Main entry point: `README.md` (table of contents only)
- Best practices: `README-best-practices.md`
- Reviews: `opus-review.md`
